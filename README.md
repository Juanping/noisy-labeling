# Overview

This repository contains a visualized simulation of a machine learning model in
the case of inaccurate labeling. We assume that data samples are marked with
positive and negative labels. However, the labels may contain errors. Formally,
each distribution: of positive and negative samples, and labels, is generated by
a 2-dimensional normal distribution (with independent dimensions).

The simulation allows for arbitrary tweaks to underlying distributions and plots
the generated data, i.e. samples and labels. The simulation also plots a ROC
curve of a straightforward SVM model trained on provided, noisy labels. The
simulation calculates the ROC curve from actual, not noisy, labels.

# Running

1. Run `setup_env.sh` to create a local `env` directory with installed
   dependencies.
2. Run `source ./env/bin/activate` to initialize the local directory.
3. Run `bokeh serve --show run.py` to open a browser tab with the simulation.
